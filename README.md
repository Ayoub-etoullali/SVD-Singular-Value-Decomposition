# Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

## Introduction
The Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) algorithm is a powerful tool for dimensionality reduction and data compression. This repository provides an implementation of the SVD algorithm in Python and demonstrates its application in image compression.

## How SVD Works
SVD decomposes a matrix into three separate matrices: U, Œ£, and V^T. U contains the left singular vectors, Œ£ is a diagonal matrix containing the singular values, and V^T represents the right singular vectors. The SVD algorithm allows us to approximate the original matrix by selecting a subset of singular vectors and values.

## Image Compression with SVD
One of the key applications of SVD is image compression. By choosing an appropriate number of singular values, we can reconstruct the image with reduced storage and transmission requirements. In this repository, we provide code that performs SVD on grayscale images and constructs approximate images with different ranks.

## Getting Started
To use the SVD algorithm and experiment with image compression, follow these steps:

1. Install the necessary dependencies (NumPy, Matplotlib) if not already installed.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Open the provided Jupyter notebook or Python script.
4. Run the code to see the SVD in action and visualize the reconstructed images at different ranks.
